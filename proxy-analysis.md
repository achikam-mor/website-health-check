## Recommended Actions

### 🚫 CRITICAL: Immediate Blacklist Candidates (18 proxies)
**Criteria: 2+ attempts with 0% success rate**

```
138.68.60.8:8080         (4 failures - WORST OFFENDER)
135.125.174.192:80       (3 failures)
190.242.157.215:8080     (3 failures)
45.88.0.99:3128          (3 failures)
45.136.198.40:3128       (3 failures)
138.68.60.8:3128         (3 failures)
139.59.1.14:8080         (3 failures)
159.203.61.169:80        (3 failures)
91.109.204.213:80        (2 failures)
80.85.246.214:5555       (2 failures)
45.88.0.116:3128         (2 failures)
45.88.0.113:3128         (2 failures)
161.35.70.249:3128       (2 failures)
62.133.63.236:1111       (2 failures)
209.97.150.167:3128      (2 failures)
161.35.70.249:80         (2 failures)
45.88.0.115:3128         (2 failures)
198.199.86.11:80         (2 failures)
```

### ⚠️ Consider for Blacklist (16 proxies)
**Criteria: Single attempt with 100% failure - need more testing**

All proxies marked "Consider blacklist" in ranks 19-34

### ✅ HIGHLY Reliable Proxies (2 proxies)
**Criteria: 3+ attempts with 100% success rate**

```
101.47.16.15:7890        (3/3 successes - 100%)
154.3.236.202:3128       (3/3 successes - 100%)
```

### ✅ Reliable Proxies (2 proxies)
**Criteria: 2 attempts with 100% success**

```
167.206.113.248:3128     (2/2 successes - 100%)
177.43.248.58:3128       (2/2 successes - 100%)
```

### ⚠️ Unstable Proxies (4 proxies)
**Criteria: Mixed results - require more testing before decision**

```
176.126.103.194:44214    (33% - 1/3 successes)
163.227.252.24:8080      (50% - 1/2 successes)
194.26.141.202:3128      (50% - 1/2 successes)
216.229.112.25:8080      (50% - 1/2 successes - IMPROVED!)
```

## Common Failure Patterns

### Most Common Errors:
1. **net::ERR_TIMED_OUT** - Connection timeout (most frequent)
2. **expect(locator).toBeVisible() failed** - Page loaded but content missing
3. **net::ERR_PROXY_CONNECTION_FAILED** - Proxy refused connection
4. **net::ERR_TUNNEL_CONNECTION_FAILED** - HTTPS tunneling failed
5. **net::ERR_CONNECTION_RESET** - Connection dropped
6. **net::ERR_EMPTY_RESPONSE** - No response from proxy
7. **Timeout 120000ms exceeded** - Playwright timeout

### IP Range Patterns (Problematic Subnets):
- **45.88.0.x:3128** subnet - 8 different IPs tested, ALL failed (98-99, 113-117)
- **138.68.60.8** with multiple ports (3128, 8080) - all failed
- **161.35.70.249** with multiple ports (80, 3128, 8080) - all failed
- **139.59.1.14** with multiple ports (3128, 8080) - all failed
- **209.97.150.167** with multiple ports (80, 3128) - all failed
- **198.199.86.11** with multiple ports (80, 8080) - all failed

### Notable Findings from Run #5:
- **216.229.112.25:8080** - Changed from failure to success (now 50% success rate)
- **176.126.103.194:44214** - Degraded from 50% to 33% success rate (2 consecutive failures)
- **3 new reliable IPs discovered**: 139.59.1.14:3128, 41.223.119.156:3128, 45.88.0.114:3128 (all failed)
